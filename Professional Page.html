<center><h1><u> My Vision </u></h1><center>

<font face= "Times New Roman" size="5">
<p><i> In the future, I hope to have a successful, stable career in either the Gaming or Technology field.
The careers I hold an interest in right now are Systems Analysis and Cloud Computing, as well as Professional Gaming.
I hope to love and enjoy my job, as that is more important to me than the money I will gain from it. One of my worst fears in
to be stuck doing a job I despise for an unimpressive amount of compensation.</i></p>

<center><h1><u> My Mission </u></h1><center>

<p><i> To get to that point, I am doing my absolute best in my studies at The University of Technology, Jamaica.
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computing. I plan to transfer to a Canadian University in 2023 to continue my studies, then find work.
According to my research, becoming a Cloud Architect/Engineer takes quite a bit of experience and knowledge,
so I will have to go through several smaller positions before I am able to get there. Until then, I will continue to study and do research on the industry,
and teach myself whatever is necessary for me to gain an advantage.</i></p>
