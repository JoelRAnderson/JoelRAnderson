<p><i> I consider one of my strengths as being a very tolerant and patient person. It takes quite a lot for me to get angry and lose my temper.
This is a trait I've has since childhood, but i have strenghted it over the last 5 years by keeping an open mind and making a concious effort to be unbothered by anything.
I have even made a promise to myself to not be a miserable and angry person. Another of my strenghts would be my constantly positive mentality.
I believe that having the right mindset in life can make a massive difference on how you see and deal with things. I really started focusing on keeping
an optimistic mindset earlier this year after I read a book named "The Magic of Thinking Big", that showed me the power of the mind.
A third strength I would say to be my ability to work and get along well with just about anyone. For me, living well with neighbours is very important in life.
In the last couple of years, I have definitely put more effort into getting along with people, whether it be saying something nice or giving a stranger a smile
or nod on the street. I have also been putting myself in the shoes of others, in an attempt to understand them and their perspectives better.</p>

<p><i> Chapters 4-7 of “Twelve	Pillars”	by	Jim	Rohn	and	Chris	Widener teach the importance of setting proper goals to achieve progress in life,
controlling your time and using it constructively as opposed to letting it control you and wasting it, choosing the company you keep and managing the time you spend with them,
as well as how much influence you let them have over you, and the importance of constant learning and reading books. Overall, I feel that this book is a great
read that teaches important life lessons anyone can use to achieve success. this book mentions another book named "The Magic Of Thinking Big", which i have read.
Both books contain life enhacing material, and teach similar lessons, and I can attest that it makes a differnce as I have been applying the things i learnt in The Magic of Thinking Big in my life and have been seeing results.
Chapter 7 of Twelve Pillars talks about how your friends can have a positive or negative impact on you and your mindset, and I definitely think I should manage my friends better,
as many of them don't give me much benefit to be around much of the time.</p>
